		<h2>Keeper Rules</h2>
		<a>
			Each team may keep up to 1 player.
			Kept players will replace that team’s draft pick according to the following formula:
		</a>
		<br>
		<a class="equation">Prev yr draft rd-(yrs kept)</a>
		<br>
		<textarea rows="5" cols="50" disabled>
2020: Justin Jefferson - rd. 13
2021: Team loses 12th rd. draft pick, 13-(1) = 12
2022: Team loses 10th rd. draft pick, 12-(2) = 10
2023: Team loses 7th rd. draft pick, 10-(3) = 7
2024: Team loses 3rd rd. draft pick, 7-(4) = 3
		</textarea>
		<br>		
		<p>
			A player’s keeper-tenure will follow them until they are released back into the draft pool. 
		</p>
		<p class="DRexcl">
			No player may be kept if it would force a team to lose a 1st or 2nd round pick. ( Result of the above equation must be > 2).
		</p>
		<p class="FAexcl">
			Keeper-eligible players must be on a roster by the trade deadline (technically 11:59pm on the night before the trade deadline)
		</p>
			Free Agent players will be given the equivalent of a final round draft pick. 
			Draft order will be reverse standings of previous season.
		</p>
		<!-- 
		<h2>
			Keeper selections will be made on the Yahoo platform by 01Sep22.
			This site is to serve as a reference for which players are eligible/ineligible for keeping.
